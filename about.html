                well then lets begin this journey and maybe
                you could one day become part of the history.<br>
                The faction was first born in 2019 when two random solos
                became good friends and wanted to start up a faction.<Br>
                After a few weeks of running as a duo we ran in to are third
                member which was II TWERK II a very inportant member<br>
                but also a great friend and still is today. the faction then
                started to grow at a fast pace having up to 50 members at one stage<br>
                but due to life taking more control or people changing
                to pc , we have lost a lot of numbers but we are back and
                ready to leave are mark once again.
                <br>

                so what are we like , well we are crazy bunch at times but
                always looking to have a laugh amd enjoy the game as it should be.<br>
